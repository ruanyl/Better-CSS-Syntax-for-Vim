What's differences with built-in CSS syntax in Vim:
    1. Support most of HTML & CSS properties, including HTML5 & CSS3.
    2. Different highlight colors for properties, value, units and so on.

NOTICE:
    DO NOT support CSS color plugin yet, I'll fix it when I have time.

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3183 this script is dumped and I will continue to update this syntax.
